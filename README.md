# Lashverb

The Grammy losing reverb of your dreams. This reverb is heavily based off of the Freeverb algorithm and its Rust implementation for learning reasons.

## Building

After installing [Rust](https://rustup.rs/), you can compile Lashverb as follows:

```shell
cargo xtask bundle lashverb --release
```
